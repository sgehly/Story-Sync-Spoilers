# Story-Sync-Spoilers
Taking a look into exploits provided in AMC's popular Story Sync.


AMC released Story Sync for a few of their hit shows, including The Walking Dead and Better Call Saul. In their implementation, there are a few exploits that can be taken advantage of to see slides before they are live to the general public. Note that this is a small (< 3 minutes most of the time) window of exclusivity, yet a window nonetheless. This script includes a way to get all the published (live and not live) images of a Story Sync schedule ID, find Story Sync schedules, and look for images on AMC's servers (read the note in the file on this one)
